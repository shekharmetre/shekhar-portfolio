        description: "I designed and developed PhoneStore, an AI-powered mobile shop management tool to streamline retail operations. Combining Supabase, PostgreSQL, Express, TypeScript, OpenAI, and Nextjs, the tool features secure authentication with Supabase, including email login, role-based access, OTP via AWS SES, and social logins. A robust PostgreSQL schema ensures scalable data handling, while custom responsive page designs enhance usability. AI assistants built with OpenAI provide contextual recommendations, and AWS Transcribe enables voice-to-text conversion. The app automates data handling from Google Sheets and generates PDFs sent via AWS SES, with modules for inventory and sales management offering real-time insights for efficient retail workflows.",
